# Norns CMake Verification Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive verification plan for the Norns CMake build system. It includes both the build verification that has been implemented in the `verify_cmake_builds.sh` script and the additional verification steps that should be performed in the future.

## 1. Comprehensive Build Testing

The `verify_cmake_builds.sh` script performs the following build verification:

- Tests builds on the DESKTOP platform with Debug configuration
- Tests selective component building (matron, crone, maiden-repl, watcher, ws-wrapper)
- Verifies that build artifacts are correctly generated
- Measures and reports build times
- Verifies that tests can be built and run
- Checks SuperCollider extension installation

### 1.1 Issues and Resolutions

During verification, the following issues were identified and addressed:

- **Release Build Failure (FIXED)**: The Release build was failing due to warnings being treated as errors in `maiden-repl/src/io.c`. Specifically, there was an unused variable `tx` in the `io_send_line` function. This has been fixed by marking the variable as intentionally unused with `(void)tx;` and adding appropriate comments.

- **Test Artifact Verification (FIXED)**: The verification script was initially looking for test artifacts that weren't actually being built or run, specifically `test_event_system` and `test_hal` in the matron component. This has been fixed by updating the script to check for the correct test artifacts that are actually being run: `test_example`, `test_crone`, `test_maiden_repl`, and the SuperCollider test script `sc_extensions_test.scd`.

- **Build Verification Improvements**: The verification script has been updated to actually attempt the Release and RelWithDebInfo builds instead of skipping them, ensuring that all build configurations are properly tested.

The remaining issues should be addressed in future work to ensure that all tests are properly built and run.

### Running the Build Verification

To run the build verification script:

```bash
chmod +x verify_cmake_builds.sh
./verify_cmake_builds.sh
```

The script will generate a detailed report in the `cmake_verification_logs` directory, including a summary of the test results and build time analysis.

## 2. Component-Specific Verification (Future Work)

## 4. Platform-Specific Testing (Future Work)

The following platform-specific tests should be performed to ensure that the build system works correctly on all supported platforms:

### 4.1 Raspberry Pi 3 (PI3)

- Verify that all components build successfully on PI3
- Test platform-specific optimizations
